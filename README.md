# smd-sixbutton-encoder
Sega Genesis/Mega Drive controller encoder in Verilog

This is a full implementation of a 6 button Sega Genesis controller in Verilog.

It features:

- Full support to the 6 button protocol, including timeout feature for the SEL signal
- Full support to the 3 button protocol if started with MODE button state as LOW

Tested with an Altera EPM7064SLC44-10N CPLD.

This is perfect to be used on custom Sega Genesis controllers without having to mess with pad-hacks!

This is a FREE implementation licensed under MIT license.
